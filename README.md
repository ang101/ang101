## Hi there, I'm Angela👋
AI Builder | Researcher | Human-Centered Technologist

I build with a focus on agentic AI systems and human-in-the-loop workflows, while using data insight to understand why we're building and how to create real value. My work bridges cutting-edge AI capabilities with thoughtful human-centered design, drawing from years of experience in data science, machine learning and human factors.

💡 Core Interests/ Current Learning 

Agentic AI Systems: Building autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and act <br>
Agentic Protocols: Understanding standards for AI agent communication, coordination, trust and evaluation <br>
Human & Work Systems: Understanding why we're building AI and how it fits into broader human and organizational contexts <br>
Agent and Workflow Design: Creating seamless human-AI collaboration patterns <br>
Human-in-the-Loop: Ensuring AI systems amplify rather than replace human judgment <br>
Rapid prototyping to validate ideas quickly <br>
Ecosystem Building: Connecting communities at the frontier of AI <br>
Responsible AI: Tech stewardship, ethics, and safety considerations in AI deployment <br>

🎯 Philosophy
I believe the future of AI isn't just about raw capability — I am excited about human augmentation and co-creation with AI <br>
